Hi doctor. I've been having these awful allergy symptoms for a while now and it's really starting

00:09.000 --> 00:13.140
to get in the way of everything. My nose is constantly runny and I'm sneezing all the time.

00:13.520 --> 00:17.060
It's like I can't catch a break. How long have you been dealing with these symptoms?

00:17.900 --> 00:22.420
Off and on for a few years, but it's been way worse this spring. It started a couple of months

00:22.420 --> 00:27.040
ago around March and it hasn't really stopped since. The mornings are the worst. I wake up

00:27.040 --> 00:31.280
with my nose completely stuffed and my eyes are all puffy and itchy. Are your symptoms

00:31.280 --> 00:35.940
forced at certain times of the day or in a particular environment? Yeah, definitely worse

00:35.940 --> 00:39.840
in the mornings. And whenever I go outside, especially when I'm around trees or grass,

00:40.060 --> 00:44.700
I think being indoors helps a bit. But it's hard to avoid going outside, you know? And whenever

00:44.700 --> 00:48.960
I open a window, it feels like the symptoms flare up again. It's frustrating because I

00:48.960 --> 00:53.600
can't even get fresh air without feeling worse. It sounds like you may be reacting to pollen.

00:53.600 --> 00:58.760
Do you also experience any symptoms like coughing or wheezing or is it mostly affecting your eyes

00:58.760 --> 01:03.820
and nose? Mostly my nose and eyes. I haven't really had much coughing, but I do get this constant

01:03.820 --> 01:07.640
itching in the back of my throat. Sometimes I feel like I have to clear my throat all the time

01:07.640 --> 01:12.620
because it gets irritated. It's not painful, but it's annoying. And my eyes, I can't stress enough

01:12.620 --> 01:17.260
how much they bother me. They get so itchy that I can barely concentrate at work. It feels like I

01:17.260 --> 01:22.760
have sand in them. The itching and irritation can definitely be common with allergic rhinitis.

01:23.280 --> 01:26.900
Do you notice the symptoms getting worse at times of the year or is this something you deal

01:26.900 --> 01:32.340
with all year long? Mostly in the spring and summer. I feel okay in the winter and things calm down a

01:32.340 --> 01:37.220
little in the fall. But once spring hits, it's like I'm constantly battling a cold. It just doesn't

01:37.220 --> 01:42.180
stop. The sneezing fits are the worst. I can sneeze like five or six times in a row and it leaves me

01:42.180 --> 01:47.400
feeling exhausted. Have you tried anything to help manage these symptoms, over-the-counter medications

01:47.400 --> 01:53.560
or home remedies? Yeah, I've tried a couple things. I've been using an antihistamine, like one of those

01:53.560 --> 01:58.140
allergy pills you can get at the pharmacy. It helps a little, but it makes me drowsy, so I can't really

01:58.140 --> 01:59.540
take it during the day if I'm working.
