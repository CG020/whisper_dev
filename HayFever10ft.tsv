0	9000	Hi doctor. I've been having these awful allergy symptoms for a while now and it's really starting
9000	13140	to get in the way of everything. My nose is constantly runny and I'm sneezing all the time.
13520	17060	It's like I can't catch a break. How long have you been dealing with these symptoms?
17900	22420	Off and on for a few years, but it's been way worse this spring. It started a couple of months
22420	27040	ago around March and it hasn't really stopped since. The mornings are the worst. I wake up
27040	31280	with my nose completely stuffed and my eyes are all puffy and itchy. Are your symptoms
31280	35940	forced at certain times of the day or in a particular environment? Yeah, definitely worse
35940	39840	in the mornings. And whenever I go outside, especially when I'm around trees or grass,
40060	44700	I think being indoors helps a bit. But it's hard to avoid going outside, you know? And whenever
44700	48960	I open a window, it feels like the symptoms flare up again. It's frustrating because I
48960	53600	can't even get fresh air without feeling worse. It sounds like you may be reacting to pollen.
53600	58760	Do you also experience any symptoms like coughing or wheezing or is it mostly affecting your eyes
58760	63820	and nose? Mostly my nose and eyes. I haven't really had much coughing, but I do get this constant
63820	67640	itching in the back of my throat. Sometimes I feel like I have to clear my throat all the time
67640	72620	because it gets irritated. It's not painful, but it's annoying. And my eyes, I can't stress enough
72620	77260	how much they bother me. They get so itchy that I can barely concentrate at work. It feels like I
77260	82760	have sand in them. The itching and irritation can definitely be common with allergic rhinitis.
83280	86900	Do you notice the symptoms getting worse at times of the year or is this something you deal
86900	92340	with all year long? Mostly in the spring and summer. I feel okay in the winter and things calm down a
92340	97220	little in the fall. But once spring hits, it's like I'm constantly battling a cold. It just doesn't
97220	102180	stop. The sneezing fits are the worst. I can sneeze like five or six times in a row and it leaves me
102180	107400	feeling exhausted. Have you tried anything to help manage these symptoms, over-the-counter medications
107400	113560	or home remedies? Yeah, I've tried a couple things. I've been using an antihistamine, like one of those
113560	118140	allergy pills you can get at the pharmacy. It helps a little, but it makes me drowsy, so I can't really
118140	119540	take it during the day if I'm working.
