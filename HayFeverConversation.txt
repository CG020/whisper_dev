Uh, hey doctor. I've been having these awful allergy symptoms for a while now and it's really starting to get in the way of everything.
My nose is constantly runny and I'm sneezing all the time. It's like I can't catch a break.
How long have you been dealing with these symptoms?
On and off for like a few years now, but it's way worse in the spring.
It started a couple months ago, around March, and honestly hasn't really stopped since.
The mornings are the worst. I wake up with my nose completely stuffed and my eyes are all puffy and itchy.
Are your symptoms worse at certain times of the day or in particular environments?
Yeah, definitely worse in the mornings and whenever I go outside, especially when I'm around trees or grass.
I think being indoors helps a bit, but it's hard to avoid going outside, you know?
And whenever I open a window, it feels like the symptoms flare up again.
It's frustrating because I can't even get fresh air without feeling worse.
It sounds like you may be reacting to pollen.
Do you also experience any symptoms like coughing or wheezing or is it mostly affecting your nose and eyes?
Mostly my nose and eyes.
I haven't really had much coughing, but I do get this constant itching in the back of my throat.
Sometimes I feel like I have to clear my throat all the time because it gets irritated.
It's not painful, but it's just annoying.
My eyes, I can't stress enough how much they bother me.
They get so itchy that I can barely concentrate at work. I feel like I have sand in them.
That itching and irritation can definitely be common with allergic rhinitis.
Do you notice the symptoms getting worse at certain times of the year or is this something you deal with all year long?
Mostly in the spring and summer. I feel okay in the winter and things calm down a little in the fall.
But once spring hits, I'm like constantly battling a cold and it just doesn't stop.
The sneezing fits are the worst. I can sneeze like five or six times in a row and it leaves me feeling exhausted.
Have you tried anything to help manage these symptoms? Over-the-counter medications or home remedies?
Yeah, I've tried a couple things.
I've been using an antihistamine, like one of those allergy pills you can get at the pharmacy.
It helps a little, but it makes me drowsy so I can't really take it during the day if I'm working.
And I've tried nasal spray, which works for the congestion, but it feels like I need to keep using it all the time for it to make any real difference.
It just gets to be too much to manage, especially when the symptoms just keep coming back.
Does anything else seem to trigger your symptoms, like pets or dust?
I don't think it's pets. I don't have any animals at home. But I've been noticing that dust does make it worse.
If I'm cleaning or even just sitting in a room that feels a little dusty, my nose starts acting up.
It's like I'm always on edge, waiting for the next sneeze or itch to hit.
I see. You mentioned feeling congested in the mornings. Do you ever feel like your symptoms disrupt your sleep?
Oh yeah. It's like I can't breathe through my nose at night, so I end up tossing and turning, trying to find a position where I can get comfortable.
Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night because my nose is so stuffed up and my throat feels so dry from breathing through my mouth.
It's definitely messing with my sleep.
Have you noticed any other related issues, like sinus pain or pressure?
Sometimes I get this pressure over my cheeks and forehead, especially if the congestion is really bad.
It's not always painful, but it feels like my face is swollen and that just adds to the discomfort.
It sounds like you're dealing with the classic symptoms of allergic rhinitis.
The triggers you've mentioned, like pollen and dust, are common culprits.
The running nose, sneezing, the itchy eyes and throat, along with the congestion, are all hallmarks of seasonal allergies.
Since over-the-counter medications haven't been fully effective for you, we might just need to adjust your treatment plan.
That would be great, because I'm really tired of feeling like this all the time. What else can I do?
Well, there's a few options you can try. We could consider an androsine to histamine that you can take during the day so it doesn't interfere with your work.
There's also prescription nasal sprays that might work better for you than the over-the-counter ones.
These can help reduce the inflammation in your nasal passages, which should ease the congestion and pressure.
Additionally, allergy shots or immunotherapy might be an option if we can confirm that your triggers through testing, especially since you're dealing with these symptoms every year.
Immunotherapy? How does that work?
It's a long-term treatment that helps your body build a tolerance to the allergens that trigger your symptoms.
Over time, it can reduce your sensitivity to things like pollen and dust.
It involves regular injections of small amounts of allergen, but it's something we consider if the other treatments aren't enough.
That sounds interesting. I'd definitely be willing to try something like that if it helps in the long run.
Yeah, let's start by adjusting your current medication and seeing how that works.
If you're still having trouble, we can discuss further steps, including testing and possibly immunotherapy.
In the meantime, it might help to keep the windows closed during the high pollen days,
and I'd recommend using an air purifier at home to reduce the dust and other allergens.
I'll definitely give that a try. I just want to get some relief.
It's so frustrating not being able to enjoy the spring without feeling miserable.
Yeah, yeah, that's completely understandable.
We'll work on getting this under control.
Let's get you started with the treatment plan today, and I'll follow up in a couple weeks to see how you're feeling.
Sounds good. Thank you, Doctor.
Awesome.
Thank you, Doctor.
Thank you.
